#  Zombie Maze: Program Description

This game is called “Zombie Maze” and it is created by Ethan Rodrigues and Aurora Chen. The objective of this game is to have the player (the robot) escape the maze alive. They will use the “w’ (up), “a” (left), “s” (down) and  “d” (right) keys to navigate, avoiding the five zombies and falling rocks, which will make them lose one of their five lives if they come in contact. To successfully escape the maze, the player must collect four keys, which unlock the gate at the end. The player also has limited vision, as the maze is dark and they only have a flashlight to see their surroundings. To learn more about how to play the game, the player can click on the instructions button on the main menu. The player can view their lives in the upper left corner of the screen, based on the amount of red hearts they have. They can see the amount of keys they have collected in the lower right corner of the screen. Once all the keys are collected, the door for the exit of the maze will open. Some limitations of this program are that collision detection is not always exact due to the fact that png images have larger borders than the images themselves that appear on the screen. This means that sometimes the player will lose a life when it does not appear that they have collided with an enemy.
